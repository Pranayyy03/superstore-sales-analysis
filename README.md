# Superstore Sales & Discount Analysis

## Objective
Analyze the impact of discounting on sales and profitability using historical Superstore data.

## Key Findings
- Discounts above 30% lead to negative profit across all categories
- Office Supplies and Technology contribute the highest absolute losses
- Higher discounts fail to generate sufficient order volume to offset margin erosion

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Business Recommendations
Cap standard discounts at 20–25% across all categories to protect unit economics

Use discounts ≥30% only for clearance or customer acquisition, not revenue growth

Prioritize pricing optimization and bundling over discount-driven volume growth
